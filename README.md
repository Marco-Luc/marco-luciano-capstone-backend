# NBA - My Starting Five

**_NBA - My Starting Five is a fully responsive, fun and interactive application for comparing NBA Player stats with custom-made digital NBA Player cards_**

**--- Please note that the only pages that are available are the Toronto Raptors team page, the Boston Celtics team page, and the Compare Stats page ---**

This is my capstone project for BrainStation's full-stack bootcamp. Students were tasked to create their very own full-stack application within a two week time frame.

NBA - My Starting Five was made using create-react-app, react-router and SASS for the front end.

I used Node/Express to create a backend API with data I retrieved myself.

üèÄ Thank you for checking out my application, I hope you have fun! üèÄ
