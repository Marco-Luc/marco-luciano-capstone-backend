# NBA - My Starting Five

**_NBA - My Starting Five is a fully responsive, fun and interactive application for comparing NBA Player stats with custom-made digital NBA Player cards_**

**--- Please note that the only pages that are available are the Toronto Raptors team page, the Boston Celtics team page, and the Compare Stats page ---**

This is my capstone project for BrainStation's full-stack bootcamp. Students were tasked to create their very own full-stack application within a two week time frame.

Watch the video of my demo **<a href="https://youtu.be/k2X_2czoUWc" target="_blank">here</a>**.

# Tech Stack

## Frontend

- **React**
- **React Router**
- **SASS**

## Backend

- **Node**
- **Express**

I used Node/Express to create the backend API with NBA team/player data I retrieved myself.

On both sides, **Axios** was used for making requests between the client and server. **npm** was used to manage the dependencies required throughout the project.

üèÄ Thank you for checking out my application, I hope you have fun! üèÄ
